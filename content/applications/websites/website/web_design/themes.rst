Odoo Themes provides a set of colors, fonts, and layouts to shape your website's style and configure
various customization options. When setting up your site using the Odoo website configurator,
selecting a theme that aligns with your desired aesthetic is imperative. If you wish to modify the
theme later, navigate to the website builder, click the 'Edit' button, and access the 'Theme' tab.

Diverse sections are at your disposal, empowering you to tailor different aspects of your site to
meet your requirements.

  Odoo pre-selected colors based on your company logo. Defining those colors in your theme ensures

  combinations.
